```{r setup, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This homework contains some data adapted from Mamerow and colleagues (2016), article to be found here:[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27684105/]. 

The study looks at risk-taking across the age span amongst 902 people aged 18-90, and looks at risk-taking in 2 different ways.

The self.csv file contains a self-reported risk taking measure, as well as background variables. Variables comprise:

* partid: participant id
* sex: (0=male, 1=female)
* age: age in years
* riskSR: self reported risk attitude  (0-10)

The gambles.csv file contains experimental data for the same participants when they performed a gambling simulation. On each trial the participant makes a forced choice decision between 2 investments, each with a specific pay-off and specific chance of success. Each time there is a risky and a safe choice, differing in profile. Any money earned is kept by the participant to incentivise them to choose realistically.

Each person did 8 trials, split into 4 'normal' and 4 'higher risk' trials, where taking the risky option would lead to a loss in the long run. The variables are:

* partid: participant id
* scenario: scenario of the gamble (there were 8 scenarios, each person saw each scenario once)
* trialtype: 0 = normal trial, 1 = higher risk trial
* RiskyChoice: 0 = safe choice chosen, 1 = risky choice chosen

First load the data and any libraries you will need.
```{r purl=FALSE}
self <- read.csv('self.csv') 
gambles <- read.csv('gambles3.csv') 
library(tidyverse)
library(lmerTest)
library(ggplot2)
```


Q1. We want to predict if self reported risk attitude is associated with age. What type of model do we need for this? What is the DV? Are there any random effects?
```{r q01}
# Linear Mixed Effects Models
# random effects: participants
```

Q2. First we will centre and scale the age variable in the `self` dataframe and call it `age_cs` Note: this is what they did in the original study (unlike previous times when we have merely centrered it).
```{r q02}
#scale the age
self <- self %>% 
  mutate(age_cs = scale(age)) %>% 
  select(-age) 
```


Q3. Plot the data showing how age predicts self reported risk taking, with a different regression line for each sex

HINT: what data type does sex need to be for this to work?
```{r q03}
# sex need to be a categorical variable
self <- self %>% mutate(sex = factor(sex))

ggplot(self, aes(x = age_cs, y = riskSR, group = sex)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_classic() + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

Q4. Find out for yourself: Try to improve the layout of the plot so that the legend informs us which line is which. HINT the layer starts with `scale_` and contains the aes mapping and the data type.

```{r q04}
ggplot(self, aes(x = age_cs, y = riskSR, colour = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "sex",
                       labels = c("male","female"))
```

Q5. What does the graph suggest about risk attitudes
```{r q05}
# For all participants, young people tend to take on more risks, with the age difference within male participants are more obvious than female (as we can see a bigger gradient shown in the diagram.)

# Also, it is worth mention that the risk attitude of male and female participants tend to convergent as age increases.
```


Q6. This code is to run the model with age_cs as a predictor and call it mod1. In the paper they included linear, quadratic and cubic effects of age.
Can you fix the code so that it runs?
```{r q06}
mod1 <- lm(riskSR ~ age_cs + I(age_cs^2) + I(age_cs^3), data=self)

summary(mod1)
```

Q7. Does adding an effect of sex improve the model - call this `mod2`? 
```{r q07}
mod2 <- lm(riskSR ~ age_cs + sex + I(age_cs^2) + I(age_cs^3), data=self)

anova(mod1, mod2)
# Yes. The p value is significant (p<.001).
```


Q8. Now lets combine the self and gambles data and call this `combi`
```{r q08}
combi <- inner_join(self, gambles, by=c("partid"))
```

Q9. Overall, on what proportion of trials did people made the riskier choice under the 'normal' and 'high risk' conditions
```{r q09}
combi %>% group_by(trialtype, RiskyChoice) %>% count()
normal_pro <- 3451*100/(3742+3451)
higher_risk_pro <- 2789*100/(4419+2789)

# for normal trial: 47.98%
# for higher risk trial: 38.69%
```

Q10. How do you interpret this in words?
```{r q10}
# when trials are more risky (trialtype=1) the tendency to choose the safer option increases
```

Q11. We want to model RiskyChoice as the dependent variable, with trialtype and age as predictors. What random effects should we consider?
```{r q11}
# partid & scenario
```
 

Q12. Build a model with a fixed effect of trial type - include random intercepts and slopes for participant and random intercepts for scenarios and call it `mod4`. 

```{r q12}
mod4 <- lmer(RiskyChoice ~ trialtype + (1|scenario) + (1|partid),
             data = combi)
summary(mod4)
```

Q13. The final question involves using Rstudio to push a file to GitHub.
